# BeaconTest
Android application to monitor Bluetooth beacons for an automated timesheet system. 
This utilised Estimote beacons to determine whether an user was in the building or not, and then this data would be sent to a MySQL database
so that it can be stored and processed by the timesheet system's web interface.
